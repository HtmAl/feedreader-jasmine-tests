# feedreader-jasmine-tests
Demonstrate the use of Jasmine for client-side unit testing

## Running the tests
1. Navigate to http://htmal.github.io/feedreader-jasmine-tests/
2. Observe the bottom section of the page and see the series of tests being executed on the page through the Jasmine testing framework.
3. To really see what's going on behind the scenes, you can open up the DevTools in Google Chrome by pressing F12 (on Windows) and clicking the "Sources" tab and inspecting the contents of the /jasmine/feedreader.js file. There you will find all the test suites and unit tests that were just executed.
